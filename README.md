# SOC Study Hub

This application is aimed to assist the SOC bootcampers with finding pervious content using filter options for week and topic. This overcomes a limitation with Slack which does not allow you to filter chat by topic or week. This will allow bootcampers to find previous content a lot faster and keep up with the fast phase of the course.

The application allows a coach to send a post. Then the bootcampers can add comments to the posts. These comments can be deleted and editied.
